# Flare Sense Chat UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Interact with AI models for blockchain and smart contract analysis
- **Contract Analysis**: Analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, code quality, and gas optimization
- **Risk Assessment**: AI-powered risk assessment for smart contracts, protocols, and blockchain addresses
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Track blockchain activity, whale movements, and security alerts in real-time

## Dependencies

This project uses several key dependencies:

- **React**: Frontend UI library
- **Material-UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **Recharts**: Data visualization library for charts and graphs
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth UI transitions

## Installing Dependencies

Make sure to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm install recharts --legacy-peer-deps  # For data visualization components
```

The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag may be necessary due to peer dependency conflicts.

## Component Structure

The application includes several key components:

- **Chat**: Main chat interface for interacting with the AI
- **ContractAnalysis**: Smart contract analysis tool that detects vulnerabilities and provides gas optimization suggestions
- **RiskAssessment**: Risk assessment tool for smart contracts, protocols, and blockchain addresses
- **MonitoringDashboard**: Real-time monitoring of blockchain activity and security alerts
